//! Central authority for outer smoothing-parameter optimization strategy.
//!
//! Every path that optimizes smoothing parameters (standard REML, link-wiggle,
//! GAMLSS custom family, spatial kappa, etc.) declares its derivative
//! capability here and receives an [`OuterPlan`] that determines which solver
//! and Hessian source to use.
//!
//! # Design invariant
//!
//! The planner never synthesizes numerical Hessians. If a path cannot provide
//! an analytic Hessian, that fact is visible in its
//! [`OuterCapability`] declaration and in the resulting [`OuterPlan`], which
//! falls back to BFGS or an EFS variant instead of synthesizing second-order
//! curvature numerically.

// Split from the original oversized module; keep included in order.
