//! #997 — the wiring seam between a fitted [`SaeManifoldTerm`] and the
//! evidence-guarded move engine of [`crate::solver::structure_search`].
//!
//! #976 closed with the move engine (`search`) and its triggers
//! ([`crate::terms::atom_codes::SparseAtomCodes::coactivation`], ARD precisions,
//! terminal [`CollapseEvent`]s) on main but deliberately unwired: nothing
//! harvested move proposals from a fitted dictionary or drove `search` around
//! the production fit. This module is that seam. It owns three things:
//!
//! 1. [`harvest_move_proposals`] — reads a fitted term + its ρ + the per-row
//!    reconstruction residuals and emits the canonical-order-ready
//!    [`MoveProposal`] stream (deaths, fusions, fission audits, births).
//! 2. [`apply_structure_move`] — the warm-inheritance restructuring of a
//!    [`SaeManifoldTerm`] under one [`StructureMove`]: a death demotes an atom's
//!    routing, a fission splits an atom into two children that inherit its
//!    decoder block, a fusion folds the weaker of a pair into the stronger, a
//!    birth appends a residual-factor atom whose TOPOLOGY is chosen by EVIDENCE
//!    (#977): [`race_birth_topology`] races the candidate bases matched to the
//!    atom's intrinsic dim (`d = 1`: circle vs line; `d = 2`: torus vs
//!    sphere/constant-curvature vs euclidean) by TK-normalized REML and seeds the
//!    born atom from the winner, so the discovered dictionary is genuinely
//!    heterogeneous rather than all-circle. Every child state is built FROM the
//!    parent (never cold) so the engine's warm-state contract holds by
//!    construction.
//! 3. [`run_structure_search_rounds`] — the round driver: fit → harvest →
//!    [`search`] (over held-out row-block shards, with warm child refits) →
//!    re-fit → repeat until a round applies no moves. The accumulated
//!    [`SearchLedger`] (with the joint fit's [`CollapseEvent`]s) is the honesty
//!    surface returned to the caller and serialized onto the fit payload.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Pure: no RNG, no clock. Proposal triggers are deterministic functions of the
//! fitted state; the engine canonicalizes and gates them; the ledger serializes
//! byte-identically for identical inputs. The structural hashes that dedup the
//! proposal stream are computed with the same [`crate::cache::Fingerprinter`]
//! the [`crate::terms::smooth::TermCollectionSpec`] machinery (#869) uses, fed
//! the POST-move dictionary shape (atom count, per-atom basis kind + latent dim
//! + the move that produced it), so two proposals that reach the same dictionary
//! shape collide exactly as the engine requires.
