//! Central authority for outer smoothing-parameter optimization strategy.
//!
//! Every path that optimizes smoothing parameters (standard REML, joint flexible
//! link, GAMLSS custom family, spatial κ, etc.) declares its derivative
//! capability here and receives an [`OuterPlan`] that determines which solver
//! and Hessian source to use.
//!
//! # Design invariant
//!
//! Finite-difference Hessian fallback is _never_ silent. If a path cannot
//! provide an analytic Hessian, that fact is visible in its
//! [`OuterCapability`] declaration and in the resulting [`OuterPlan`].
//! The previous pattern of returning `None` from a closure and letting
//! `CachedSecondOrderObjective` silently FD is what this module replaces.
