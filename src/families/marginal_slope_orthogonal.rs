//! Neyman-orthogonal, cross-fitted marginal-slope calibration (closes #461):
//! the Stage-1 score-influence Jacobian and the absorbed influence block.
//!
//! Stage 1 (a conditional transformation-normal, "CTN", model) fits a monotone
//! `h(y | x; θ₁)` and emits a latent score `z_i = Φ⁻¹(u_i)` from the
//! finite-support PIT
//!
//!     u_i = [Φ(h_i) − Φ(L_i)] / [Φ(U_i) − Φ(L_i)],
//!
//! with (SCOP form, see `transformation_normal.rs`)
//!
//!     h_i = b(x_i) + ε·(y_i − median) + Σ_{k≥1} I_k(y_i)·γ_k(x_i)²
//!     L_i = h(y_min | x_i),  U_i = h(y_max | x_i)
//!     b(x_i)   = Xᶜᵒᵛ_i · θ_b           (location column, response basis col 0)
//!     γ_k(x_i) = Xᶜᵒᵛ_i · θ_{γk}         (squared SCOP shape coeffs, cols k≥1).
//!
//! Stage 2 (marginal-slope) treats `z_i` as a **generated regressor**:
//! `z_i` depends on the Stage-1 estimate θ̂₁, so the β estimating equation is
//! not orthogonal to θ₁. This module exposes the score-influence Jacobian
//! `J = ∂z/∂θ₁` (design §2) and the absorbed influence block
//! `Z_infl = diag(s_f·β̂₀)·J` (design §3); Stage 2 appends `Z_infl` as a
//! null-penalized absorbed block, making the β estimating equation orthogonal
//! to `span(Z_infl)` — the discrete realization of `ψ − Π_η[ψ]`.
//!
//! ## Column ordering of `J`
//!
//! `θ₁` is the Stage-1 coefficient vector of length `p₁ = p_resp · p_cov`,
//! reshaped row-major to the `(p_resp, p_cov)` matrix `Γ` (`beta_mat`):
//! response component `k` (row) crossed with covariate column `j` (col). The
//! flat index of `Γ[k, j]` is `k·p_cov + j`. **`J`'s columns follow exactly
//! this order**: column `k·p_cov + j` holds `∂z_i/∂Γ[k, j]`. Response row
//! `k = 0` is the unconstrained location block `b(x)`; rows `k ≥ 1` are the
//! squared SCOP shape blocks for `γ_k(x)`.
