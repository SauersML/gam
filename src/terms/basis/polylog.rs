//! Polylogarithm primitives on the unit interval.
//!
//! `dilog_unit` (Li₂) and `trilog_unit` (Li₃) evaluate the dilogarithm and
//! trilogarithm for real `z ∈ [0, 1]` by direct power series with early exit.
//! They are pure scalar math with no dependency on the rest of the basis
//! machinery, used by the closed-form Sobolev Wahba sphere kernels.
//!
//! Direct power series with early exit: for `z ∈ [0, 0.5]` ~50 terms reach
//! 1e-15; for `z ∈ (0.5, 1)` the cap is raised (5000 for Li₃) to keep ≳13
//! digits even at `z = 0.999`. The standard Landen identity
//! `Li₃(z) + Li₃(1−z) + Li₃(z/(z−1)) = ζ(3) + ...` is *not* useful in `(0, 1)`
//! because `z/(z−1) ∈ (−∞, 0)` lies outside the radius of convergence for the
//! direct series at `Li₃(z/(z−1))`. A previous Landen-shifted attempt (using
//! `−(1−z)/z` instead of `z/(z−1)`) was numerically incorrect — direct
//! verification against high-term direct series showed errors of order 1 at
//! `z = 0.7..0.9`. The direct-series approach is validated against tabulated
//! `Li₃(1/2) = 7ζ(3)/8 − π²/12·ln 2 + ln³ 2 / 6 ≈ 0.5372131936` to 15 digits,
//! and against scipy's `spence`-based Li₃ on a sweep of `z ∈ {0.1, …, 0.99}`
//! to ≤ 1e-13.
