//! Host-side classification tests for the Arrow-Schur GPU entry point's
//! "dense shared β-block absent" decline (no CUDA required — the decision is
//! taken before any device probe, so these run on macOS/CI).
//!
//! Regression for the fatal-vs-decline bug: a default product-patch SAE fit
//! (frames-engaged, `K=48`, `d_atom=2`) assembles a system whose β-curvature is
//! carried by a matrix-free `penalty_op` and whose dense `H_ββ` is reclaimed to
//! a `0×0` workspace before the solve. When such a system reached the dense
//! device Schur path, [`solve_arrow_newton_step`] returned
//! `SchurFactorFailed { reason: "CUDA arrow-Schur requires a dense shared beta
//! block" }`. That variant is a NUMERICAL failure the outer LM loop escalates
//! and ultimately surfaces as a FATAL `RemlConvergenceError` — instead of the
//! documented "device declined, fall back to CPU" contract. The entry point now
//! DECLINES (`GpuRequiresDenseSystem`) so the host routes to the CPU lane that
//! consumes the matrix-free operators.
