//! The cost is arrow-shaped, but the REML log|H| gradient carries a shared
//! Schur⁻¹ factor handled as one-time-per-outer-iteration setup plus N
//! rank-≤d per-row traces; that is the source of the explicit precondition
//! story below.
//!
//! ## What this module does
//!
//! When a [`gam_terms::latent::LatentCoordValues`] block is
//! registered with the design, each inner Gauss–Newton iteration must
//! solve the same normal equations that bundle adjustment solves:
//! per-3D-point blocks are our per-row latent coordinates `t_i`, and
//! per-camera shared parameters are our decoder coefficients `β`.
//!
//! ```text
//! [ H_tt   H_tβ ] [ Δt ]     [ -g_t ]
//! [ H_βt   H_ββ ] [ Δβ ]  =  [ -g_β ]
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//!
//! * `H_tt` is **block-diagonal in rows** — `N` independent `d × d`
//!   blocks `H_tt^(i)` (one per observation). This is the load-bearing
//!   structure exploited here.
//! * `H_tβ`, `H_βt = H_tβ^T` are row-local in `t` and dense in `β` —
//!   each row `i` contributes a `d × K` slab.
//! * `H_ββ` is the standard `K × K` penalized Hessian already handled by
//!   the existing PIRLS β-only path.
//!
//! BA's reduced camera system (RCS) eliminates `Δt` first and produces the
//! reduced `K × K` shared system
//!
//! ```text
//! S · Δβ = -g_β + Σ_i H_βt^(i) (H_tt^(i))⁻¹ g_t^(i),   S = H_ββ - Σ_i H_βt^(i) (H_tt^(i))⁻¹ H_tβ^(i)
//! ```
//!
//! followed by row-local back-substitution
//!
//! ```text
//! Δt_i = -(H_tt^(i))⁻¹ (g_t^(i) + H_tβ^(i) Δβ).
//! ```
//!
//! Per inner iteration: `O(N d³)` for the per-row Cholesky factors, the
//! Schur subtraction, and the back-substitution, plus one standard
//! `K × K` solve for `Δβ`. Memory is `O(N d²)` for the per-row factors
//! plus the existing `O(K²)` β workspace.
//!
//! ## Scope — what is and is not in this file
//!
//! **In scope.** The arrow-Schur elimination of `H_tt` *for the inner
//! Gauss–Newton step*. The block-diagonality of `H_tt` is the property
//! that makes per-row elimination cheap; this is correct as long as
//! penalty contributions to `H_tt` are themselves row-block-diagonal
//! (true for [`gam_terms::analytic_penalties::ARDPenalty`] — diagonal —
//! and for [`gam_terms::analytic_penalties::IsometryPenalty`] in its
//! metric-residual Gauss–Newton form — per-row `d × d` blocks through
//! `∂(J_n^T W_n J_n)/∂t_n`).
//!
//! **Out of scope (do not confuse).** The REML *outer-loop* gradient of
//! `log|H|` with respect to `t` carries a shared `Schur⁻¹` factor; only
//! row `i` of `Φ` moves with `t_i`, but `Schur⁻¹` itself is dense in all
//! `t`. That requires one dense `Schur⁻¹` formation per outer iteration
//! plus N rank-≤d per-row traces. It is **not** handled here — that's a
//! separate plumbing change owned by the REML driver. The two cost
//! analyses must not be conflated: the *inner* step is genuinely
//! O(N d³ + K³); the *outer* gradient is O(K³ + N · K d) once `Schur⁻¹`
//! is in scope.
//!
//! Future maintainers: this is BA. Solver improvements should first look
//! at Ceres/g2o/MegBA/Square-Root BA literature, not bespoke algebra. If you
//! find yourself extending `ArrowSchurSystem` with an outer-REML gradient
//! hook, re-read the inner/outer cost split documented above first.

// Re-modularized into real concern submodules under `arrow_schur/`. The shared
// external imports, tuning constants, and function-pointer aliases live in
// `prelude`; every other module pulls them in through `use super::*;`. The
// parent re-exports each module's surface so the long-standing
// `crate::arrow_schur::<Item>` paths used across the crate keep
// resolving unchanged.
