//! Alternating minibatched trainer: route → sparse codes → decoder refresh →
//! unit-norm projection. No dense `N×K` object is ever formed.
//!
//! The decoder refresh is the **method of optimal directions** (MOD) restricted
//! to the sparse support. With codes fixed, the reconstruction loss
//! `Σ_i ‖x_i − Σ_j c_{ij} d_{a_{ij}}‖²` is quadratic in the decoder `D` and its
//! normal equations are `D (CᵀC + ρI) = CᵀX`, where `C` is the (sparse, never
//! materialised) `N×K` code matrix. We accumulate `A = CᵀC` (`K×K`, but only
//! the few entries touched by co-active atoms are non-zero) and `B = CᵀX`
//! (`K×P`) by streaming minibatches, then solve **to the rank-charge floor**.
//! For a clean `top_s = 1` lane `A` is diagonal and the refresh is a per-atom
//! rescaled mean — exactly MOD / k-SVD's dictionary step. For the general
//! `s > 1` case the coupling `A` is non-diagonal, and the co-firing graph
//! percolates at realistic scale, so connected components are diagnostics rather
//! than a useful dense-solve decomposition. The default coupled solve is
//! therefore matrix-free conjugate gradients: every Gram-vector product touches
//! only the streamed sparse normal equations (`O(K + nnz)`) and no dense `K×K`
//! block is formed. Dense Cholesky is retained only for genuinely tiny connected
//! components. CG stops when the relative normal-equation residual is below the
//! ridge/charge floor, and its Lanczos tridiagonal supplies the condition
//! estimate reported with the epoch diagnostics.
