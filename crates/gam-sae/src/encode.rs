//! Kantorovich-certified encode atlas (issue #1010).
//!
//! Encoding a row `x ∈ ℝᵖ` against a FROZEN SAE dictionary is, per atom `k`,
//! the coordinate-only Newton problem
//!
//! ```text
//! min_t  f_k(t) = ½‖x − z_k · B_kᵀ Φ_k(t)‖² + prior_k(t),
//! ```
//!
//! with the amplitude `z_k` and decoder block `B_k` held fixed (the encode
//! freezes the dictionary; only the latent coordinate `t` moves). Newton on
//! `F(t) = ∇f_k(t)` converges quadratically from a start `t₀` into the unique
//! root in a certified ball whenever the **Newton–Kantorovich** quantity
//!
//! ```text
//! h = β · η · L ≤ ½,    β = ‖F'(t₀)⁻¹‖,   η = ‖F'(t₀)⁻¹ F(t₀)‖,
//! ```
//!
//! where `L` is a Lipschitz constant of `F'` (the Hessian of `f_k`) on a region
//! containing the Newton iterates. `h` is CHECKABLE per row in `O(q³)`
//! (`q = latent_dim`, tiny), so each fast-path encode carries its own
//! exactness certificate.
//!
//! ## The closed-form Hessian-Lipschitz constant `L`
//!
//! Write `m(t) = z·BᵀΦ(t) ∈ ℝᵖ` (the reconstruction) and `r(t) = m(t) − x`.
//! Then `f = ½‖r‖² + prior` and, differentiating three times,
//!
//! ```text
//! ∇³f = 3·sym(J_mᵀ : ∇²m) + ⟨r, ∇³m⟩ + ∇³prior,
//! ```
//!
//! so an operator-norm bound on the chart is
//!
//! ```text
//! L ≤ 3·‖J_m‖·‖∇²m‖ + ‖r‖·‖∇³m‖ + L_prior,
//! ```
//!
//! with `‖∂^g m‖ ≤ |z|·(Σ_m ‖B_{m,:}‖)·B_g`, where `B_g = sup_chart max_m
//! ‖∂^g Φ_m‖` is the per-column jet sup of the basis family — closed form per
//! family ([`BasisHessianLipschitz`]). `‖r‖` is bounded by `‖x‖ +
//! |z|·(Σ_m‖B_{m,:}‖)·B_0`. The ARD/von-Mises prior `L_prior` is a closed-form
//! constant from the prior strength. Every bound is conservative (an
//! over-estimate of `L` only SHRINKS the certified radius — it can never
//! certify a row that does not converge).
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! 1. **Offline, per atom** ([`EncodeAtlas::build`]): chart centers `t_c` on the
//!    atom's coordinate grid (the SHAPE_BAND grid idiom), each with a certified
//!    Newton radius `R_c` solved from the Kantorovich inequality at the
//!    worst-case in-chart start.
//! 2. **Online, per row** ([`EncodeAtlas::certified_encode_row`]): route to the
//!    nearest chart, start from its distilled IFT predictor, take one or two
//!    Newton steps, then the `h ≤ ½` check AT the start point is the per-row
//!    certificate.
//! 3. **Uncertified tail**: rows whose start fails `h ≤ ½` are FLAGGED (counted
//!    in [`EncodeResult::encode_uncertified_count`]) and must be routed by the
//!    caller to the existing exact multi-start solve. No approximation enters
//!    silently.
