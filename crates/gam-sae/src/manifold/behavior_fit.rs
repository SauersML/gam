//! Rung-2 two-block REML fit driver: joint activation+behavior fitting with the
//! relative block weight `λ_y` selected by REML — never a knob.
//!
//! # The objective
//!
//! The two-block model gives each output block its own Gaussian dispersion —
//! `φ_x` for the activation reconstruction, `φ_y` for the nats-unit behavior
//! tangent target — while every structural parameter (the latent coordinate
//! `t`, the gates `a`, both decoders `[B_k | C_k]`) is shared through the
//! augmented fit on `Z̃ = [Z | √λ_y·Y]` with `λ_y = φ_x/φ_y`. Profiling both
//! dispersions at a fitted state (block residuals `R_x = ‖Z − Ẑ‖²`,
//! `R_y = ‖Y − Ŷ‖²` in *unscaled* units) makes the criterion's `λ_y`-dependence
//!
//! ```text
//!   (n·p̃/2)·log((R_x + λ_y·R_y)/(n·p̃)) − (n·p_y/2)·log λ_y ,
//! ```
//!
//! (the second term is the `√λ_y` target-scaling Jacobian,
//! [`BehaviorBlock::reml_log_lambda_jacobian`]) whose unique stationary point is
//! the closed-form variance ratio
//!
//! ```text
//!   λ_y = (R_x/p_x) / (R_y/p_y)
//! ```
//!
//! ([`BehaviorBlock::reml_updated_log_lambda_y`]) — the classical REML estimate
//! of a variance-component ratio under a shared mean structure. The driver
//! below alternates (fit at fixed `λ_y`) ↔ (closed-form `λ_y` update at the
//! fitted residuals): block-coordinate descent on the joint profiled criterion,
//! each half-step solving its subproblem exactly. No grid search, no
//! user-tuned weight.
//!
//! # Payoffs realized here
//!
//! * **Gauge fixed by data** — the behavior block enters the same arrow-Schur
//!   inner solve that estimates `t`, so the latent coordinate is oriented by
//!   how the *output* changes, not by an arbitrary activation convention
//!   (see `tests_behavior_twoblock_rung2` for the planted case where the
//!   activation alone cannot orient `t` and the behavior block pins it).
//! * **Calibrated units** — the behavior target is nats-unit by construction
//!   ([`SphereTangentEmbedding`](crate::manifold::SphereTangentEmbedding)), and
//!   `λ_y` only sets the *inferential weight* of those units, so the fitted
//!   `C_k` always decodes to honest distributions ([`BehaviorBlock::split_decoder`]
//!   un-does the `√λ_y`).
//! * **Selection for mattering** — behaviorally inert structure has a zero
//!   behavior target; its residual variance ratio drives `λ_y` (and the atom's
//!   behavior decoder) toward earning nothing from the y-block evidence rather
//!   than manufacturing spurious weight.
