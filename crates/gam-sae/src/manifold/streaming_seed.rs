//! Chunked-seed accumulation for the overcomplete (`K > P`) hard-TopK CURVED
//! lane (#2134 walls 1+2, #1893).
//!
//! The cold-start seed fits each atom's decoder by least squares of the gated
//! design `D_k = diag(a_·k)·Φ_k` (`N × M_k`) against the current residual
//! `R` (`N × P`): `β_k = D_k⁺ R`. The dense path
//! ([`super::SaeManifoldTerm::seed_cold_start_disjoint_charts`]) forms the whole
//! `(N × M_k)` design and solves it with a thin SVD
//! ([`super::solve_design_least_squares`]). At LLM scale (`N` in the millions)
//! that full-height design is exactly the resident intermediate the front door
//! refuses to let the driver build.
//!
//! This module builds the SAME per-atom seed from the NORMAL EQUATIONS
//! accumulated one row chunk at a time:
//!
//!   * `G_k = D_kᵀ D_k`   (`M_k × M_k`, symmetric PSD — the design Gram);
//!   * `B_k = D_kᵀ R`     (`M_k × P`      — the design/residual cross term).
//!
//! Both are plain sums of per-row rank-1 contributions, so summing a corpus's
//! chunks yields the identical `(G_k, B_k)` as the full-batch build regardless
//! of the chunk boundaries (addition is associative; the per-row terms are
//! accumulated in row order, so the result is BIT-for-bit chunk-invariant — see
//! [`tests::chunk_accumulation_is_bit_invariant`]). The seed is then the
//! pseudo-inverse solve `β_k = G_k⁺ B_k`, which — because `G_k = V Σ² Vᵀ` and
//! `B_k = V Σ Uᵀ R` share the design's right singular vectors — equals the thin
//! SVD solve `V Σ⁻¹ Uᵀ R` the dense path produces, to tolerance, at the SAME
//! rank cutoff (`σ ≤ σ_max·ε·max(N, M)`, applied here as `μ ≤ μ_max·(ε·max(N,
//! M))²` on the Gram eigenvalues `μ = σ²`; see
//! [`tests::chunked_normal_eq_matches_dense_svd_seed`]).
//!
//! Peak memory is the chunk window `O(chunk_rows · M_k)` plus the two
//! accumulators `O(M_k² + M_k·P)` — never `O(N · M_k)`.
