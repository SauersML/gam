/// Numerically stable `C(n,k) = n! / (k!·(n−k)!)` as `f64`.  Uses the
/// symmetry `C(n,k) = C(n, n−k)` to keep the loop count `min(k, n−k)`
/// and the multiplicative recurrence `C(n,j+1) = C(n,j)·(n−j)/(j+1)`,
/// avoiding the overflow of separate factorial evaluations.  Returns
/// `0.0` for `k > n` and exact integer results within `2^53`.
