//! `RowMetric` — the single provenance-carrying per-row inner product shared by
//! the SAE-manifold **likelihood** (residual whitening) and the **gauge**
//! (isometry pullback weight).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The SAE-manifold machine historically carried *two* independent inner
//! products:
//!
//! * the **likelihood** measured reconstruction residuals isotropically — a
//!   single scalar dispersion `φ̂ = RSS / residual-dof`, the data-fit loop
//!   summing the bare `½ rᵀr`; there was no per-row metric at all; and
//! * the **gauge** carried its own per-row metric in
//!   `IsometryPenalty.weight: WeightField` — a low-rank `W_n = U_n U_nᵀ`
//!   pullback `g_n = J_nᵀ W_n J_n`, settable independently of anything the
//!   likelihood saw.
//!
//! Nothing structurally forced "the metric the likelihood whitens by" to equal
//! "the metric the gauge pulls back through". That is exactly the
//! objective↔gradient-desync bug class wearing geometry clothing: a
//! likelihood-metric ≠ gauge-metric state was *representable*.
//!
//! `RowMetric` collapses the two into one object. The likelihood whitens
//! through it; the gauge `WeightField` is *constructed from* it. A
//! divergent-metric state is therefore unrepresentable — there is only one
//! per-row factor stack `U_n`, with one [`MetricProvenance`] tag.
//!
//! # Magic-by-default selector
//!
//! There is no flag. The provenance is chosen by whether per-row Fisher factors
//! exist:
//!
//! * no factors supplied ⇒ [`MetricProvenance::Euclidean`]; `W_n = I_p`;
//!   whitening is the identity, so `φ̂` and the data-fit loop are
//!   **bit-for-bit** the prior isotropic path; and
//! * per-row Fisher factors supplied ⇒ [`MetricProvenance::OutputFisher`]; the
//!   residual is whitened by `U_nᵀ` and the gauge pulls back through the same
//!   `U_n`.
//!
//! # Validation
//!
//! Every metric block is constructed **through**
//! [`crate::normalize_fisher_rao_blocks`], which
//! broadcasts and eigenvalue-validates PSD-ness. `RowMetric` does not
//! reimplement that validation; it materializes `W_n = U_n U_nᵀ` (which is PSD
//! by construction) and runs it through the shared normalizer as the
//! single point of truth for "is this a valid precision metric".
//!
//! Any rank floor used to make a block invertible for an internal solve is
//! **solver-only** (mirroring `RidgePolicy::solver_only`, #747): it never enters
//! the residual the objective sums, so `δ` cannot bias the criterion.
