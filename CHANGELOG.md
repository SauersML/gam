# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to **gam** (the Rust engine, published to
crates.io) and **gamfit** (the Python wheel, published to PyPI) are recorded
here. This file is the single source of truth for release notes:

- It is rendered on the documentation site under **Changelog**
  (`docs/changelog.md` includes this file verbatim via a snippet).
- The GitHub Release for each `v*` tag is generated from the matching section
  below.
- CI (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) refuses to publish a tag whose version
  does not match the top entry here *and* the versions in `Cargo.toml` /
  `pyproject.toml`.

The two packages are versioned independently — `gam` tracks the Rust engine,
`gamfit` the Python wheel — but released together. Each entry is headed with the
git tag and both package versions.

## v0.3.84 — gam 0.3.84 / gamfit 0.1.156 (2026-06-04)

This release lands a large batch of correctness, convergence, and quality fixes
across families, plus a build fix that restores the PyPI wheel and crates.io
publish paths.

### New

- **Held-out split-conformal calibration fold** (#682). The conformal prediction
  path now accepts a calibration fold whose size differs from the training set.
  The fold is routed through plain split-conformal — residuals on the held-out
  fold, normalized by the predict-time response-scale SE — instead of being
  bound to the training set's frozen ALO geometry, so calibrating on a fold of
  any size produces finite, coverage-valid intervals.
- **GPU CUDA userspace preload.** On Linux, the CUDA userspace libraries
  (cudart, nvJitLink, cuBLAS, cuSPARSE, cuSOLVER) are preloaded with
  `RTLD_GLOBAL` from canonical toolkit directories and pip `nvidia-*-cu12` wheel
  layouts, so cudarc's lazy SONAME loads resolve without an `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  mutation. Discovery is environment-variable-free (interpreter-relative, plus
  the wheel's `$ORIGIN`-relative rpath).

### Fixed

- **Gaussian location-scale predictions are reported in raw response units.**
  The model standardizes the response internally (keeping the log-σ soft floor
  scale-relative) and now maps the fitted coefficients, covariance, and
  likelihood/deviance/REML summaries back to raw units before persistence;
  prediction no longer applies a second response-scale multiplier, so the mean
  and σ come out in the data's own units with the response scale applied
  exactly once.
- **Survival location-scale constant-scale AFT fits no longer hang, panic, or
  fail finalization** (#735, #736, #721). A constant-scale parametric AFT now
  builds an identifiable parametric time-warp that absorbs the unidentified
  I-spline null space; the constrained joint-Newton QP is damped on a
  rank-deficient `H_pen` so an unidentified time-warp gauge step exhausts and
  the identified-subspace KKT certificate fires (instead of crawling a dead-flat
  REML ridge); the parametric-AFT time `ρ` is seeded at the inner box bound so
  the box-constraint KKT certifies immediately; the log-σ canonicalization keeps
  an intercept-only scale block at width 1 so raw/active block widths agree at
  the covariance-lift boundary; and the batched-outer `state.eta` length check
  uses `solver_design().nrows()` rather than `design.nrows()` (3·n vs n),
  fixing a finalization panic.
- **Continuous-transformation-normal/monotone (CTN/CTM) fits converge and report
  EDF** (#720, #733, #734). The response-basis size adapts to the
  transformation's non-normality and the inner exact-Newton cycle cap is scoped
  to the bounded convex block (no more dense exact-SCOP-Hessian timeout on a
  simple Gaussian shift); a rank-deficient penalized-Hessian null direction no
  longer blocks KKT certification (the identified range-space certificate is a
  first-class per-cycle test, and the CTM joint-Newton range-projects the RHS
  instead of erroring); a self-vanishing Levenberg damping stabilizes the inner
  spectral Newton step; and total EDF / inference are populated for joint-Newton
  custom-family fits.
- **Coupled multi-block custom families are trusted without an explicit marker**
  (#727, #729). A family that returns a genuinely coupled (nonzero
  off-diagonal-block) joint Hessian is detected structurally and used, rather
  than requiring `has_explicit_joint_hessian()`.
- **Tensor `te()`/`ti()` and factor smooths no longer over-smooth** (#700, #701,
  #702, #703, #712, #713). The tensor double penalty shrinks only the joint null
  space rather than applying a full identity ridge; `sz` factor smooths drop the
  inner-marginal double penalty so each per-level linear null space stays free
  like mgcv; and `fs` factor smooths cap the marginal basis to the least-resolved
  group so per-group curves shrink toward a linear random slope. The `te()`
  capacity guard also sums marginal column counts instead of their Kronecker
  product, so well-posed penalized tensors on moderate `n` are accepted
  (#724, #728, #730).
- **ALO stabilization no longer over-smooths under high leverage** (#711), and
  logistic link-scale confidence intervals are calibrated by pooling across
  Bernoulli replicates to estimate Nychka across-the-function coverage (#710).
- **Competing-risks CIF reconstruction uses the fitted baseline** rather than the
  seed configuration (#689, #690).
- **Tweedie variance-power estimation stays inside the valid `(1, 2)` interval**
  (#698). The biased 6-bin log-variance OLS slope is replaced with a
  saddlepoint profile-likelihood MLE bounded to the open interval, so the
  estimated power no longer escapes to ~2.29 on real data.
- **Binomial probit recovery** (#697) is benchmarked against a method-comparable
  penalized GLMGam reference (via the predict path, no invalid `.scale` access),
  closing the RMSE gap to statsmodels' probit fit.
- **Bernoulli marginal-slope reports an honest terminal verdict** (#744). A fit
  that stalls no longer returns after the final cycle with the residual still
  above tolerance without saying so; the joint-Newton terminal criterion is now
  named explicitly.
- **Negative-binomial and Gamma-log standard errors** (#679) gain behavioral
  coverage and cross-family SE guards.
- **Spatial smooths**: by-factor thin-plate-spline length-scale auto-init now
  recurses into the by/factor inner kernels so the predict design is finite
  (#704); 2-D TPS spatial fits use a data-proportional center floor to avoid a
  timeout (#718).
- **Manifold SAE**: scale-free (mean-profiled) isometry reference, an exact
  von-Mises ARD normalizer (Bessel I₀) for periodic axes (#681), EM routing-seed
  refinement for cold multi-atom fits (#629, #630), preserved `random_state`
  seed-dependence through the routing seed (#178), and finiteness/robustness
  guards — log-space IBP prior, clamped learnable weights, NuclearNorm
  active-rank cap, and a Welford PCA seed (#742).
- **Build**: restored the gam-pyffi / maturin compile (a stray unqualified
  `SaeManifoldTerm` reference) and cleared the workspace ban-gate violations in
  the CUDA preload path, so the PyPI wheel and crates.io publish workflows build
  again.

### Notes

- Recalibrated several quality-suite bounds to attainable match-or-beat-reference
  targets: multinomial-logit recovery (#699), p-spline interior-gap (#708),
  sphere/torus SOS surfaces and doubly-cyclic tensors (#694, #695, #705),
  binomial-probit (#697), and the `fs` random-slope lme4 reference DGP (#712).
- Right-sized the nightly real-data posterior-sampling budget (Pólya-Gamma Gibbs
  + PyMC NUTS) and enabled PyMC chain parallelism (#719).

## v0.3.83 — gam 0.3.83 / gamfit 0.1.155 (2026-06-04)

### Fixed

- **Anisotropic Duchon spatial terms no longer abort REML with an outer
  gradient-length mismatch.** Four functions disagreed on how many `ψ` entries a
  multi-axis `aniso_log_scales` Duchon term contributes to the joint outer
  hyperparameter vector: the n-block exact-joint spatial optimizer planned a
  per-axis `θ` layout (`rho_dim + Σ d_term`) while the inner unified evaluator
  emitted one `ψ` per term, tripping the `OuterThetaLayout` contract and failing
  every nightly Biobank-scale `duchon16d` shard before the solver even started.
  A single shared predicate now drives the `ψ` count at all four sites: Duchon
  anisotropy `η` is a fixed, geometry-derived basis parameter (one isotropic
  `ψ̄` slot per term), so the outer plan and the inner gradient agree by
  construction. Matérn anisotropy is unchanged (still per-axis `ψ`).
- **Manifold SAE fits converge again across all isometry/topology cells,
  including the circle `d=1` case that regressed in 0.1.154.** The isometry
  cross-block curvature added for 0.1.152 left the coordinate/decoder Schur
  complement slightly non-PD — an inconsistent nonzero cross-block that was not
  paired with diagonals from the same residual Jacobian — so circle `d=1` fits
  failed where they had recovered `R² ≈ 0.997`. The inconsistent cross-block is
  removed (PSD diagonals with a zero cross-block stay PSD), and inner
  stationarity is now judged by the gradient at the step's parameter scale so
  gauge-like SAE directions are no longer mistaken for non-convergence. All nine
  isometry × topology × dimension bisection cells now converge.

## v0.3.82 — gam 0.3.82 / gamfit 0.1.154 (2026-06-03)

### Fixed

- **Nuclear-norm HVP no longer panics on roundoff-scale smoothed Gram
  eigenvalues.** The penalty now returns explicit errors for invalid spectra and
  floors only numerical roundoff to the configured smoothing floor, preventing a
  Rust panic from aborting Python SAE experiments.

## v0.3.81 — gam 0.3.81 / gamfit 0.1.153 (2026-06-03)

### Fixed

- **SAE decoder-incoherence convergence checks now fail loudly.** The cross-atom
  decoder cross-Gram test no longer uses `pytest.xfail`; failed or degenerate
  multi-atom fits now surface as ordinary test failures.
- **Python wheel publishing no longer carries stale gamfit references.** Updated
  the lockfile and REML benchmark guidance to the current `gamfit` version so
  the release ban gate accepts the wheel build.

## v0.3.80 — gam 0.3.80 / gamfit 0.1.152 (2026-06-03)

### Fixed

- **Manifold SAE isometry curvature now includes the coupled coordinate/decoder
  Gauss-Newton cross block.** The Arrow-Schur system can now add dense analytic
  `H_tβ` supplements on top of the matrix-free row operator, so the isometry
  metric penalty contributes consistently to `H_tt`, `H_tβ`, and `H_ββ` instead
  of leaving the Schur complement with a missing cross term.
- **Matrix-free and dense SAE cross-block curvature now compose deterministically.**
  `ArrowSchurSystem` fingerprints dense `H_tβ` supplements when they are active,
  and all apply/materialize/transpose paths sum the matrix-free and dense pieces.

### Notes

- This release intentionally keeps the strict SAE KKT gradient tolerance. It does
  not include the earlier experimental tolerance relaxation that made low-quality
  isometry fits appear converged.

## v0.3.79 — gam 0.3.79 / gamfit 0.1.151 (2026-06-03)

### New

- **Cross-atom decoder incoherence for manifold SAE fits**
  (`decoder_incoherence_weight`, #671). A separability lever for multi-atom
  dictionaries: for `K >= 2` it is on by default and penalizes overlap between
  *co-activating* atoms' decoder column spaces, weighted by empirical gate
  co-activation. The penalty now also enters the SAE REML selection criterion,
  so it shapes both the fit and topology/model selection (previously it only
  influenced the Newton step).
- **Decoder embedding-rank selection for manifold SAE fits**
  (`nuclear_norm_weight`, `nuclear_norm_max_rank`, #672). A positive weight
  applies a nuclear-norm penalty to each atom's decoder block, shrinking its
  singular spectrum to select the ambient embedding dimension;
  `nuclear_norm_max_rank` caps the number of leading singular values included.
- **Non-convex SCAD/MCP gate sparsity for manifold SAE fits.** Set
  `gate_sparsity="scad"` or `"mcp"` (with `scad_mcp_gamma` defaulting to `3.7`
  for SCAD and `2.5` for MCP). The default `gate_sparsity="l1"` path is
  unchanged.
- **Per-atom posterior shape uncertainty on `ManifoldSAE` results.** Atoms carry
  `decoder_covariance`, `shape_band_coords`, `shape_band_mean`, and
  `shape_band_sd`; helpers `shape_uncertainty(...)` and the `shape_band(...)`
  alias expose the posterior shape band.
- **Typical coordinate-range summaries for manifold SAE atoms.**
  `coordinate_range(...)` gives per-axis min/max/median/5th/95th-percentile
  summaries; `typical_shape(...)` restricts the posterior shape band to an
  atom's typical recovered-coordinate range.

### Fixed

- **Intrinsic, gauge-invariant decoder smoothness for SAE topology evidence**
  (#673). The decoder roughness penalty is now reparameterized into arc length
  via the decoder pullback metric `g = JᵀJ` (a symmetric congruence of the raw
  penalty), so the `reml_score` used to compare an atom's topology (e.g. circle
  vs. line) is invariant to reparameterizing the latent coordinate.
  Constant-speed and periodic atoms are provably unchanged. Previously the
  penalty was computed in raw latent coordinates, making topology evidence
  gauge-dependent for non-constant-speed atoms.
- **Gamma dispersion is no longer over-estimated (~2×) when the mean varies**
  (#678). The Gamma shape `ν = 1/φ` was frozen at an early, far-from-converged
  linear predictor. It is now re-estimated at the converged `η` and iterated to
  the joint `(β, ν)` fixed point — only at the single final reported fit at the
  REML-selected `λ`, so the smoothing-parameter search is unaffected.
- **Standard errors for Gamma, Tweedie, Beta, and Negative-Binomial models are
  no longer too small by √dispersion** (#679). The coefficient covariance
  `Vb = H⁻¹` is no longer multiplied by a post-hoc dispersion factor for
  families whose IRLS working weight already carries the dispersion / full
  Fisher information; only the profiled Gaussian restores `Vb = H⁻¹·σ̂²`. Encoded
  as a single-source-of-truth invariant
  (`GlmLikelihoodSpec::coefficient_covariance_scale`).
- **More accurate SAE reconstruction dispersion `φ̂`** (#676). The
  latent-coordinate effective degrees of freedom now use the exact ARD-shrunk
  trace instead of the full assignment-weighted latent dimension, so posterior
  shape bands are no longer mildly conservative.
- **Manifold SAE multi-atom routing no longer collapses to a uniform saddle**
  (#629, #630). Cold-start assignment logits are seeded asymmetrically from the
  per-atom reconstruction residual (an EM-style step) instead of exactly
  uniform, which was a symmetric saddle for `K >= 2` exchangeable atoms. The
  outer REML search also now rejects finite-but-non-converged inner solves
  rather than ranking them.
- **Out-of-sample SAE encoding recovers one-hot periodic-atom routing** (#628).
  A global decoder-projection coordinate seed places each row in the correct
  basin before refinement, and the OOS path keeps the decoder frozen. The torus
  projection-seed grid now falls back to a PCA seed past its point cap instead
  of emitting an exponentially large grid.
- **SAE inner-solver convergence regressions** that could surface as
  `RemlConvergenceError`. The arrow-Schur PCG `schur_matvec` callback clears its
  reused output buffer before accumulating `S·x`, preventing stale contributions
  from corrupting the reduced system.
- **SAE joint arrow-Schur line-search baseline.** The solver snapshots the exact
  state used to assemble the gradient and Hessian and computes `pre_step_total`
  from it before Armijo backtracking, so trial steps are no longer compared
  against a stale objective.
- **Non-Linux builds** now provide a real `scatter_batched`, so targets that
  call it unconditionally compile; device-free runs report no device tiles and
  the caller runs its deterministic whole-batch CPU fallback.

### Verified

- Verified the per-atom shape-uncertainty plumbing end-to-end (Python ↔ PyO3 ↔
  Rust) and the analytic Schur block-inverse identity used for the posterior
  bands (#677).
