# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to **gam** (the Rust engine, published to
crates.io) and **gamfit** (the Python wheel, published to PyPI) are recorded
here. This file is the single source of truth for release notes:

- It is rendered on the documentation site under **Changelog**
  (`docs/changelog.md` includes this file verbatim via a snippet).
- The GitHub Release for each `v*` tag is generated from the matching section
  below.
- CI (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) refuses to publish a tag whose version
  does not match the top entry here *and* the versions in `Cargo.toml` /
  `pyproject.toml`.

The two packages are versioned independently — `gam` tracks the Rust engine,
`gamfit` the Python wheel — but released together. Each entry is headed with the
git tag and both package versions.

## v0.3.79 — gam 0.3.79 / gamfit 0.1.151 (2026-06-03)

> Supersedes the yanked `gam` 0.3.78: that tag failed a release-time
> version-reference check (`build.rs`) before any wheel shipped, so `gamfit`
> 0.1.151 is published for the first time here.


### New

- **Cross-atom decoder incoherence for manifold SAE fits**
  (`decoder_incoherence_weight`, #671). A separability lever for multi-atom
  dictionaries: for `K >= 2` it is on by default and penalizes overlap between
  *co-activating* atoms' decoder column spaces, weighted by empirical gate
  co-activation. The penalty now also enters the SAE REML selection criterion,
  so it shapes both the fit and topology/model selection (previously it only
  influenced the Newton step).
- **Decoder embedding-rank selection for manifold SAE fits**
  (`nuclear_norm_weight`, `nuclear_norm_max_rank`, #672). A positive weight
  applies a nuclear-norm penalty to each atom's decoder block, shrinking its
  singular spectrum to select the ambient embedding dimension;
  `nuclear_norm_max_rank` caps the number of leading singular values included.
- **Non-convex SCAD/MCP gate sparsity for manifold SAE fits.** Set
  `gate_sparsity="scad"` or `"mcp"` (with `scad_mcp_gamma` defaulting to `3.7`
  for SCAD and `2.5` for MCP). The default `gate_sparsity="l1"` path is
  unchanged.
- **Per-atom posterior shape uncertainty on `ManifoldSAE` results.** Atoms carry
  `decoder_covariance`, `shape_band_coords`, `shape_band_mean`, and
  `shape_band_sd`; helpers `shape_uncertainty(...)` and the `shape_band(...)`
  alias expose the posterior shape band.
- **Typical coordinate-range summaries for manifold SAE atoms.**
  `coordinate_range(...)` gives per-axis min/max/median/5th/95th-percentile
  summaries; `typical_shape(...)` restricts the posterior shape band to an
  atom's typical recovered-coordinate range.

### Fixed

- **Intrinsic, gauge-invariant decoder smoothness for SAE topology evidence**
  (#673). The decoder roughness penalty is now reparameterized into arc length
  via the decoder pullback metric `g = JᵀJ` (a symmetric congruence of the raw
  penalty), so the `reml_score` used to compare an atom's topology (e.g. circle
  vs. line) is invariant to reparameterizing the latent coordinate.
  Constant-speed and periodic atoms are provably unchanged. Previously the
  penalty was computed in raw latent coordinates, making topology evidence
  gauge-dependent for non-constant-speed atoms.
- **Gamma dispersion is no longer over-estimated (~2×) when the mean varies**
  (#678). The Gamma shape `ν = 1/φ` was frozen at an early, far-from-converged
  linear predictor. It is now re-estimated at the converged `η` and iterated to
  the joint `(β, ν)` fixed point — only at the single final reported fit at the
  REML-selected `λ`, so the smoothing-parameter search is unaffected.
- **Standard errors for Gamma, Tweedie, Beta, and Negative-Binomial models are
  no longer too small by √dispersion** (#679). The coefficient covariance
  `Vb = H⁻¹` is no longer multiplied by a post-hoc dispersion factor for
  families whose IRLS working weight already carries the dispersion / full
  Fisher information; only the profiled Gaussian restores `Vb = H⁻¹·σ̂²`. Encoded
  as a single-source-of-truth invariant
  (`GlmLikelihoodSpec::coefficient_covariance_scale`).
- **More accurate SAE reconstruction dispersion `φ̂`** (#676). The
  latent-coordinate effective degrees of freedom now use the exact ARD-shrunk
  trace instead of the full assignment-weighted latent dimension, so posterior
  shape bands are no longer mildly conservative.
- **Manifold SAE multi-atom routing no longer collapses to a uniform saddle**
  (#629, #630). Cold-start assignment logits are seeded asymmetrically from the
  per-atom reconstruction residual (an EM-style step) instead of exactly
  uniform, which was a symmetric saddle for `K >= 2` exchangeable atoms. The
  outer REML search also now rejects finite-but-non-converged inner solves
  rather than ranking them.
- **Out-of-sample SAE encoding recovers one-hot periodic-atom routing** (#628).
  A global decoder-projection coordinate seed places each row in the correct
  basin before refinement, and the OOS path keeps the decoder frozen. The torus
  projection-seed grid now falls back to a PCA seed past its point cap instead
  of emitting an exponentially large grid.
- **SAE inner-solver convergence regressions** that could surface as
  `RemlConvergenceError`. The arrow-Schur PCG `schur_matvec` callback clears its
  reused output buffer before accumulating `S·x`, preventing stale contributions
  from corrupting the reduced system.
- **SAE joint arrow-Schur line-search baseline.** The solver snapshots the exact
  state used to assemble the gradient and Hessian and computes `pre_step_total`
  from it before Armijo backtracking, so trial steps are no longer compared
  against a stale objective.
- **Non-Linux builds** now provide a real `scatter_batched`, so targets that
  call it unconditionally compile; device-free runs report no device tiles and
  the caller runs its deterministic whole-batch CPU fallback.

### Verified

- Verified the per-atom shape-uncertainty plumbing end-to-end (Python ↔ PyO3 ↔
  Rust) and the analytic Schur block-inverse identity used for the posterior
  bands (#677).
